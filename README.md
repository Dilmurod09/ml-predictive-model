# Machine Learning Predictive Modeling Project

This project was developed as a **team project** to apply machine learning techniques for predictive analysis.  
We explored, processed, and modeled real-world data using multiple algorithms, evaluated their performance, and explained the results with interpretable tools.



## 🎯 Project Goal
To build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict outcomes based on input data.  
(*e.g. customer churn, student performance, housing prices*)



## 🧠 Key Steps
- **EDA:** data visualization, correlation analysis  
- **Preprocessing:** handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling  
- **Modeling:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV  
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
- **Interpretability:** SHAP and LIME explanations  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, **SHAP**, **LIME**  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, VS Code



## 📈 Results
- Built and compared multiple models with strong predictive performance  
- Identified key features using SHAP values  
- Provided insights and recommendations based on model interpretation


## 👥 Team Contribution
- Worked on **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **result interpretation**
- Contributed to feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning



## 🚀 Next Steps
- Try additional models (XGBoost, CatBoost)  
- Deploy the model with Streamlit
